- Created a Google account.

## You will learn
- How to create and run an Android app using the wizard
- How to use Google Firebase to enable push notifications when generating an Android app using the wizard

### Create the project


>Please read **Prerequisites** first.

1.  Open **Android Studio**.

2.  Choose **New SAP BTP Android App**

    ![New project](new-project.png)

3.  The wizard can save server connection details for multiple servers. Fill in the required fields as shown below.

    | Field | Value |
    |:----|:----|
    | Account Name | **`SAP Mobile Services`** |
    | Admin API URL | **`See below for how to get this URL`** |
    | Admin UI URL | **`See below for how to get this URL`** |
    | Authentication Type | **`Basic`** |
    | Username | **`Username for your account`** |
    | Password | **`Password for your account`** |
    | Save Account Information | **`Check this so that you do not have to re-enter account information on subsequent runs of the wizard`** |

4.  Go to the **SAP Mobile Services cockpit** and under **Important Links**, both Admin URLs are present and can be copied.

    ![Admin API and UI URL](admin-url.png)

    ![Server connection](server-connection.png)

5.  Click **Next** in the **Server Connection** screen.

6.  Select **Sample** in the **Cloud Configuration** screen and set the **Application ID** to **`com.sap.wizapp`**.

    ![Sample tab information](sample-application-wizard.png)

7.  SAP Mobile Services provides a sample back-end destination called `com.sap.edm.sampleservice.v2`, which is used here to provide data for the application. It includes product categories, products, suppliers, customers and sales order data. Select it and click **Next**.

    ![Odata service destination screen](Odata-service-destination.png)

8.  Provide the following configuration data in the **Android Studio Project** screen.

    | Field | Value |
    |:----|:----|
    | Project Name | **`Wiz App`** |
    | Project Namespace | **`com.sap.wizapp`** |
    | UI Framework | **`View-based UI`** / **`Jetpack Compose-based UI`** |

    ![Project configuration](project-configuration.png)

9.  Provide the following configuration data in the **Project Features** screen.

    | Field | Value |
    |:----|:----|
    | Enable Multiple Users | **`uncheck`** |
    | Activation Options | **`Generate AppConfig.json`** |
    | OData | **`Online`** |
    | Create a Sample User Experience for the Selected OData Destination | **`check`** |
    | Enable Logging | **`check`** |
    | Enable Upload | **`check`** |
    | Enable Usage Reporting | **`check`** |
    | Enable Crash Reporting | **`optional`** |
    | Enable Push | **`optional`** |

    ![Project features](push-notification-checkbox-enabled.png)

10.  If you would like to add push notification support to your app, proceed to **Step 2**, which describes how to acquire the `google-services.json` file required for cloud messaging. Otherwise, uncheck **Enable Push**, click **Finish** and proceed to **Step 3**.



### Enable push notifications


If you check the **Enable Push** checkbox, an error message will appear, indicating that you need to specify a `google-services.json` file. We will obtain this file from the [Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) feature in [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

![Push Notifications enabled](push-notification-checkbox-enabled.png)

1.  Open the [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) console and click **Create project**. (If you have created any before, click **Add project**.)

    ![Add project in Firebase](firebase-add-project.png)

2.  Click **Continue** until a new project is successfully created.

3.  Navigate to the **Project settings** for the newly created project.

    ![Project settings](firebase-project-settings.png)

4.  Scroll down and add a Firebase to your app.

    ![Add Firebase to your Android app](add-firebase-to-android.png)

    The **Android package name** must match the **Project Namespace** you used to create the app in Android Studio. In our example, the **Android package name** is **`com.sap.wizapp`**.

    ![Register App](firebase-register-app.png)

5.  Download the `google-services.json` file.

    ![Download google-services.json file](download-google-services-button.png)

6.  Now browse for the `google-services.json` file in the wizard. This file is located in the generated project's app folder, enabling the app to work with Google Firebase notifications.

    ![Add google-services.json file to wizard](wizard-google-services-added.png)

    >You can add push configuration on the server as in the [Send Notifications to Your Android Application](sdk-android-wizard-app-push) tutorial.

7.  Click **Create** and proceed to **Step 3**.



### Explore the app


1.  Wait for the build to finish.

    ![Project created](project-created.png)

    >You may encounter a build error similar to: "Could not resolve all files for configuration ':classpath'......", open **Preferences** (Windows: **Settings**, Mac: **Android Studio > Settings...**) to change `gradle jdk` to 17.
    ![Set gradle jdk to 17](gradle-jdk.png)

    >Finally, sync the project with the gradle files.
    ![Sync project with gradle files](sync-gradle.png)

2.  Choose an emulator for running the app.
    >If you enabled the push service, please ensure you install an emulator with the **Target** labeled as **Google Play**. For more information on creating virtual devices that run in the Android Emulator, see [Create and manage virtual devices](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) in the Android Studio User Guide.

    ![Deployment target](choose-emulator.png)

3.  Click the **Run** toolbar icon.

    ![Run the project](run.png)

    The welcome screen is displayed the first time the app is launched.

    ![Welcome screen](welcome-screen.png)

4.  Check the agreement, click **Get Started**, and the sign-in screen is displayed. Log in with your username and password.

    ![Authentication screen](authentication-screen.png)

    The credentials you enter are securely stored by the app, and do not need to be re-entered the next time you open the app.

    The passcode (or fingerprint if enabled) screen provides an additional layer of security for your app.

    ![Passcode screen](create-passcode.png)

5.  You can modify the passcode policy in the [Mobile Service Cockpit](https://mobile-service-cockpit-web.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/) under **Client Configuration** in **Mobile Settings Exchange** page. The passcode screen will not be displayed if the **Enable Passcode Policy** is not checked.

    ![Mobile Settings Exchange page access](access-mobile-settings-exchange.png)

    ![Passcode Policy](passcode-policy.png)

6.  **Enable Usage Reporting** is checked, this screen can display details about how the collected data will be utilized. For now, select either **Allow** or **Deny**. **Usage Reporting** is covered in another tutorial in this mission.

    ![Usage Reporting Consent Screen](usage-reporting-consent-screen.png)

7.  Similar to `Usage Reporting`, if **Enable Crash Reporting** is checked, this screen will show details about how the collected information will be used. Choose either **Allow** or **Deny**. If you select **Deny**, the crash information will only be stored locally.

    ![Crash Reporting Consent Screen](crash-reporting-consent-screen.png)

8.  Click **Next** on the **Allow Notifications** screen to choose either **Allow** or **Don't allow** to indicate whether you want the app to send you notifications.

9.  The first screen of the app displays various entities that are available in the sample OData service.

    ![Entities screen](entities-screen.png)

    Tap **Products** to navigate to the products list.

    ![Products screen](products-screen.png)

10. Tap a list item to display the following editable detail screen.

    ![Category detail](product-detail.png)

>For further information on generating your app, see [Creating Apps with the Wizard](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/getting-started/android/creating-an-app.html).

Congratulations! You have created your first Android app using the SAP BTP SDK Wizard for Android!
